                            Whether it's at school or university, the one thing no one ever teaches you is how to teach
                            yourself. All you actually do is memorize information in order to regurgitate when you take
                            the
                            test. You get drilled on how to solve specific exercises so that while you know exactly what
                            you
                            need to do when exam time comes around, do you truly understand the subject material? All
                            you've
                            really learned is how to pass that one test. Once that test is over, the information in your
                            head has outlived its usefulness.
